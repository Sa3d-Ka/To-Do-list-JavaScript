# To-Do List-JavaScript

A simple, interactive to-do list web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, check off, and delete tasks, with task data saved in the browser's local storage for persistence.

- **Mark Task as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks appear with a line-through effect.
- **Delete Task**: Click the "×" icon next to any task to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so they remain even after refreshing or reopening the page.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The HTML structure of the application.
